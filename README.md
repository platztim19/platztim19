- Hi, Iâ€™m Tim Platz / @platztim19
- Iâ€™m interested in reading (mostly fantasy as of late), creative writing, language, gaming, and coding
- Iâ€™m currently learning web development through FullStackOpen and German through a number of sources, including DuoLingo and watching old movies in German
- The first major goal I've set for myself is to create a website for learning some of the basic facets of German, such as early Vocabulary and Grammar concepts.
- The way I see it, my two primary interests at the moment can feed into one another.
